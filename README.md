# Environment Mapping (NEXUS)
NEXUS is the environment mapping for the ARES project. NEXUS will take a 2D array of integers returned from GRIDEYE after the object detection process and build out a map of the world represented as a graph.

This will assist the reinforcement learning agent in being able to navigate the world.
